\title{Plot one-day mixing diagram.}
\usage{
plot_mdiag_1d(mdiag, id.day, day.only = T, rh = F, FM = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{mdiag}{the input object as an output of mixing_diagram}

\item{id.day}{It can be in integer format to define the number of the day for
plot. Or it can be in PCICt or Date format to define the specific date for
plot.}

\item{day.only}{If only plot the daytime period (default) or the entire
day. Note that day.only=T may lead to error if there is a polar night.}

\item{rh}{Whether relative humidity is plotted or not (default) as contour
lines in the background.}

\item{FM}{Whether the vectors of surface and atmosphere are plotted or not
(default).}
